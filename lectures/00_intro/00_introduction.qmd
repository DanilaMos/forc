## What this course is about?

This is an introductory course dedicated to control over robotic systems (mainly fully actuated). You will learn:

- Recall of modeling techniques, simulators (MuJoCo)
- Analysis of linear and nonlinear systems
- Linear control (PD, PID, pole placement, etc.)
- Basics of nonlinear control (Feedback linearization, gravity compensation etc.)
- Intro to advanced control techniques (optimal and adaptive control, model predictive, etc.)

## Course Organization

- Online lectures
- Practice/lab sessions
  - Implementing concepts in Python
  - Interactive sessions in Google Colab
- **Hand-written notes encouraged**
- Midterm and final exams
