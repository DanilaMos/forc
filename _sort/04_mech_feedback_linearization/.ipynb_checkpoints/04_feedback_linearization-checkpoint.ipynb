    "It seems that the controll over fully and underactuated mechanical systems are in general similar, in fact if we have more actuators they provide some flexibility in to control design by means of proper optimization over control inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, control over underactuated systems is **drastically different and much more challenging**. First of all we cannot always hope to convert our dynamics in to the decoupled double integrator and even not all trajectories are **dynamically feasible** and it is out of scope of this class. "
